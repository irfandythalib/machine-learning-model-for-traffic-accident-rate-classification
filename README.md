# machine-learning-model-for-traffic-accident-rate-classification

In this code, I present how to create a machine learning model using python.

The library used is SKlearn

In row 2, you see the selection of columns that are used as attributes and labels. Column 1 is the label

Testing and training data sharing method is 33%

The algorithm used is:
Neural network
SVM
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes

It can be seen that the SVM algorithm is superior to other algorithms (92.7% Mean) for this case
